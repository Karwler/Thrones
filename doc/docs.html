	<h3>Tile amounts</h3>
	<p>A list of the amounts of each player's homeland tiles.

	<h2 id="h2_3">2.3 Setups</h2>
	<p>
		Game setups are stored in "setup.ini" and can be edited, saved and loaded in the "Host -&gt; Setup" menu or during the in-game setup phase. The offline editor works the same as setting up a game online, except any checks for proper tile placement and such will be ignored.<br>
		When loading a setup, it only overwrites the current tiles/pieces of each stage when the loaded setup's corresponding stages' tile/piece data is present.<br>
		The same setup can be loaded for different configurations, but some tiles and pieces may not get placed due to exceeding limits.
	</p>

	<h1 id="h3_0">3 Networking</h1>

	<h2 id="h3_1">3.1 Client</h2>
	<p>
		A game client can be used as a server by going into the "Host" menu, optionally setting an appropriate port and the configuration that'll be used for the game rules, and clicking "Open". Once another client successfully connects to the server, a game will start immediately.<br>
		A client can set an address and port of a server and connect by clicking the "Connect" button in the main menu. When connecting to a regular server program, a list of open rooms will be displayed. A room can be joined by left clicking its name or a new one can be created by clicking "Host". Only a room's host can edit the configuration and start the game.<br>
	</p>

	<h2 id="h3_2">3.2 Server</h2>
	<p>
		The server program can be used to host multiple players and is currently limited to a maximum of 128 players and 64 rooms.<br>
		When running it in the foreground, the following keys can be used:
	</p>
	<table class="listing">
		<tr>
			<td>P</td>
			<td>list players</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>R</td>
			<td>list rooms</td>

	<h1 id="h4_0">4 Game</h1>
	<p>Every game starts with the setup stage where players place their tiles and pieces. Once both players confirm their setups, the actual match starts.</p>

	<h2 id="h4_1">4.1 Setup</h2>
	<p>
		The setup stage is a sequence of three phases of placing homeland tiles, middle row tiles and pieces.<br>
		Tiles/pieces can be placed by dragging them with the left mouse button from the bottom icons or by selecting an icon in the bottom panel and left click holding on a free tile and optionally dragging the cursor across other occupied tiles to replace them. A type can be selected by pressing the icon, using the mouse wheel or pressing a number key. It's possible to drag a tile/piece with the left mouse button and place it somewhere else or switch places with another. Tiles/pieces can be removed by using the "Delete" button or right click holding on them and possibly dragging the cursor onto other ones.<br>
		Fortress tiles will be places automatically, where no tiles were placed.<br>
		After the setup the host program determines the first player, the middle row tiles will be rearranged accordingly and the match starts.

	<h2 id="h4_2">4.2 Match</h2>
	<p>
		Normally pieces can be moved by dragging them with the left or right mouse button and whether they'll move, switch or attack depends on the destination. Firing pieces can fire by dragging them with the right mouse button or using the "Fire" button. A warhorse can only attack when being dragged with the right mouse button or using the "Fire" button.<br>
		Holding the left Alt key or the X1 mouse button on the first action of a turn initializes a Fate's Favor for the piece that will be or is currently being dragged. When holding down left Shift or X2 instead, the Fate's Favor will be used on the current action. A mountain Fate's Favor is automatically used, when using any Fate's Favor on a piece that couldn't normally move onto a mountain, while it's being moved onto a mountain.<br>
		A turn ends by pressing the Space bar or middle mouse button or when the limit of actions has been reached.<br>
		The camera can be rotated by holding down the left Ctrl key, zoomed with the mouse wheel and reset by pressing the C key.<br>
		The chat overlay can be toggled with the Tab key.
