	<h3 class="intro">Based on the board game by Chad Anthony Randell:</h3>
	<p class="intro">
		"Thrones is a game designed to cultivate cunning and strategic maneuvering on a battlefield created by you, your opponent, and the battle between you.<br>
		The struggle for supremacy will take many forms as your infantry melee, cavalry charge, and artillery fire.<br>
		You may strike with your Throne’s royal guard or unleash a Dragon on any challenger to your claim. Not even fate itself is out of your influence and reach.<br>
		Your enemies, however, are diverse, and their lands will be treacherous to a conqueror. Destruction of their armies is just one path to victory;<br>
		If you succeed in claiming their Fortress as your own, a pretender’s family will surely plea for peace, which you can consider as their army disbands in defeat."

	<h1>Playing The Game</h1>
	<h2>Actions</h2>
	<p>Players choose to Move and/or Switch pieces, or Attack, or Fire during their turn. Pieces can move over allied pieces if able. Use your actions to keep your frontline adaptable and aggressive.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Move and/or Switch pieces:</li>
		<ol>
			<li>Move a piece one tile in any direction.</li>
			<li>Switch positions with an adjacent, allied piece of a different type.</li>
		</ol>
		<li>Engage another piece by Attacking or Firing</li>
		<ol>
			<li>Attacking: Occupying a tile and removing it's piece.</li>
			<li>Firing: Removing a piece on a different tile without moving.</li>
		</ol>
	</ul>
	<p>Dragons and Lancers are the only pieces that can move over (certain) enemy pieces.</p>

	<h2>Terrain</h2>
	<p>Each tile affects how a piece interacts with the battlefield and it’s opponents.</p>
	<table class="listing">
		<tr>
			<td>Mountains</td>
			<td>
				Cannot be attacked, switched onto by any piece, or be fired over.<br>
				They can only be occupied by Dragons and Rangers.<br>
				Pieces on a Mountain can move onto any adjacent Mountain.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Forests</td>
			<td>Cannot be fired on or attacked by Dragons.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Water</td>
			<td>Must succeed a Survival Check to take action against or off of the tile. Spearmen always pass this check, and if they switch with another piece, that piece also always passes for that turn.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<h2>Survival Check</h2>
	<p>Flip a coin, roll a die, or use the #2 method from “Gameplay” to make a Survival Check! Only one per piece is necessary.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Succeed the check with an even number: the piece may move, switch, attack, or fire at will.</li>
		<li>Fail the check with an odd number: that piece doesn’t move, switch, or fire for that turn. If a check fails during an attack, your opponent may move that piece to any adjacent tile for that turn. In either failure, that player’s turn continues.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Fortresses</h2>
	<p>A piece occupying a Fortress tile has high walls and battlements keeping it safe- it cannot be engaged (attacked or fired on) until the Fortress is breached.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A successful attack or firing (determined by a Survival Check) breaches the Fortress tile.</li>
		<li>A breached Fortress is flipped upside-down, and its occupant now engageable next turn.</li>
		<li>The Fortress does not restore (unbreach) itself until it is unoccupied at a turn’s end.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Warhorses can only switch positions with any piece occupying a Fortress (except Spearmen) if it is breached.</p>

	<h2>Fate’s Favor</h2>
	<p>
		When the Throne occupies a Fortress different from the one it did previously, it’s controller gains a special, single-use Fate’s Favor tile, indicated by taking one of the extra tiles the game has.<br>
		A player can use one of the below tile effects to add to a Move/Switch Action:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Cunning (Mountain): </b>Allows any allied piece to move onto a nearby Mountain.</li>
		<li><b>Haste (Plains): </b>Adds 1 tile of movement to any allied piece that player controls.</li>
		<li><b>Ambush (Forest): </b>Switches positions of two allied pieces on Forests that player controls.</li>
		<li><b>Daring (Water): </b>Switches positions of any two adjacent pieces without Survival Check.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There is a max of any 4 total FF tiles per player. Each turn, only one FF tile may be spent by the player. A player needs to reveal what FF tile they have only when they use that particular tile. Don’t let your opponent see it!</p>

	<h1>Gameplay</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Each player gets 13 Pieces, 13 Plains, 10 Forest, 7 Water, 5 Mountain, and 1 Fortress.</li>
		<li>Players choose even or odd, and hold numbers on their hands behind their backs and reveal them simultaneously; the sum of the numbers decides who goes first. A sum of 10 requires a redo. Survival Checks can also be resolved this way.</li>
		<li>Set rule board as a screen so players cannot see opponent's homeland, and then lay pieces and home tiles; at least one of each tile type must be in each of the 4 rows and Fortresses cannot border game board boundaries.</li>
		<li>Each player is given 4 tiles (one of each type) and puts them between their front tile row and the screen, intended as where they want them placed in the middle row</li>
		<li>Remove screen. If both players have set middle row tiles for the same contested place, first place all uncontested tiles down in the middle row; then move both contested tiles to the leftmost open space of the player that is moving first, starting from their left.</li> 
		<li>The middle row Fortress occupies wherever no tile was set, after all 8 tiles are set.</li>
		<li>The game starts! Whichever player goes first cannot attack/fire that turn. Winning requires the removal of your opponent's Throne or occupying the opponent's homeland Fortress with your Throne.</li>
	</ol>
