	<h3 class="intro">Based on the board game by Chad Anthony Randell:</h3>
	<p class="intro">
		"Thrones is a game designed to cultivate cunning and strategic maneuvering on a battlefield created by you, your opponent, and the battle between you.<br>
		The struggle for supremacy will take many forms as your infantry melee, cavalry charge, and artillery fire.<br>
		You may strike with your Throne’s royal guard or unleash a Dragon on any challenger to your claim. Not even fate itself is out of your influence and reach.<br>
		Your enemies, however, are diverse, and their lands will be treacherous to a conqueror. Destruction of their armies is just one path to victory;<br>
		If you succeed in claiming their Fortress as your own, a pretender’s family will surely plea for peace, which you can consider as their army disbands in defeat."

	<h1>Playing The Game</h1>
	<h2>Your Turn</h2>
	<p>Each player must choose to either move/switch pieces, attack, or fire each turn.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Move and/or Switch pieces in any order</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Move a piece one tile in any direction, unless otherwise specified.</li>
			<li>Switch positions with an adjacent, allied piece of a different type.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Engage another piece or occupied Fortress either by</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Attacking: Occupying a tile and removing it's piece.</li>
			<li>Firing: Removing a piece on a different tile without moving.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<h2>Survival</h2>
	<p>
		If a piece is move/switching from, attacking onto/from, or firing onto/from a  Mountain or Water tile, a Survival Check is made to see if fate impeded its efforts.<br>
		This is done by flipping a coin, rolling an even-numbered die, or using the #2 method in Standard Gameplay.<br>
		Remember, if a piece is only moving onto a Mountain or Water tile, no check occurs!
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Survive the check with an even number; the piece may move, attack, or fire that turn.</li>
		<li>Fail the check with an odd number; the move/firing does not occur, and the player ends their turn. If the check failed during an attack, the piece is removed from the game.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If Rangers switch positions with a piece occupying a Mountain, or if Spearmen switch positions with a piece occupying Water, both pieces always pass the Survival Check that their switching piece always passes that turn.</p>

	<h2>Then a Dragon Showed Up</h2>
	<p>
		If they did not place it at the beginning of the game, a player may choose to use their turn to place their Dragon on any unoccupied, homeland Mountain.<br>
		Alternately, they can choose to place it in their homeland Fortress and restart that turn, removing any piece (opponent or allied) occupying that Fortress from the game.
	</p>

	<h2>Breaching Fortresses</h2>
	<p>
		A piece occupying a Fortress cannot be engaged until the Fortress is breached. A successful attack or firing (determined by a Survival Check) breaches the Fortress tile.<br>
		A breached Fortress is flipped upside-down, and its occupant now vulnerable to attack next turn. The Fortress does not restore itself until it is unoccupied at a turn’s end.<br>
		A Throne’s attack will breach the Fortress AND remove it’s occupier in one move.<br>
		A Warhorse can switch positions with a piece occupying a Fortress but it cannot switch positions with an enemy Warhorse in any circumstances.
	</p>

	<h2>Fate’s Favor</h2>
	<p>When the game starts with a Throne occupying a Fortress, and/or when the Throne occupies a Fortress different from the one it did previously, it’s controller gains a special, single-use Fate’s Favor tile (indicated by taking one of the extra tiles the game has)</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Haste (Plains): </b>Adds 1 tile of movement to an allied piece that player controls.</li>
		<li><b>Ambush (Forest): </b>Switches positions of two allied pieces on Forests that player controls.</li>
		<li><b>Cunning (Mountain): </b>Automatically pass a Survival Check that player controls.</li>
		<li><b>Deception (Water): </b>Switches positions of any two adjacent pieces without Survival Check.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There is a max of any 4 total per player. Only one FF tile may be spent by each player per turn. A player only needs to reveal what FF tile they have when they use that particular tile. They can use one at any time.</p>

	<h1>Gameplay</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Each player gets 15 Pieces: 11 Plains, 10 Forest, 7 Water, 7 Mountain, and 1 Fortress.</li>
		<li>Players choose even or odd, and hold numbers on their hands behind their backs and reveal them simultaneously; the sum of the numbers decides who goes first. Survival Checks can also be resolved this way.</li>
		<li>Set rule board as a screen so players cannot see opponent's homeland, and then lay pieces and home tiles; at least one of each tile type must be in each of the 4 rows and Fortresses cannot border game board boundaries.</li>
		<li>Each player is given 4 tiles (one of each type) and puts them between their front tile row and the screen, intended as where they want them placed in the middle row.</li>
		<li>Remove screen. If both players have set middle row tiles for the same contested place, first place all uncontested tiles down in the middle row; then move both contested tiles to the leftmost open space of the player that is moving first, starting from their left.</li> 
		<li>The middle row Fortress occupies wherever no tile was set, after all 8 tiles are set.</li>
		<li>Whichever player goes first cannot attack/fire that turn. Winning requires the removal of your opponent's Throne or occupying the opponent's homeland Fortress with your Throne.</li>
	</ol>
