## Playing The Game  

### Your Turn  
Each player must make only one of these actions per turn.  
- Move a piece one tile in any direction, unless otherwise specified.  
- Switch positions with an adjacent, allied piece of a different type.  
- Engage another piece or occupied Fortress either by:  
  - Attacking: Occupying a tile and removing it's piece.  
  - Firing: Attacking a piece on a different tile without moving.  

### Survival  
To take any Actions on to/off of a Mountain or Water tile, like firing onto or moving off it, a piece must first make a Survival Check to see if fate impeded their efforts. It’s owner must roll an even-numbered die, flip a coin, or players must use #2 method in Standard Gameplay.  
- Survive the check with an even number; the piece may move, attack, or fire for that turn.  
- Fail the check with an odd number; the move/firing does not occur, and the player ends their turn. If the check failed during an attack, the piece is removed from the game.  

Throne pieces cannot be removed by a failed check; the turn ends when they fail instead.  
If Rangers switch positions with a piece occupying a Mountain, or if Spearmen switch positions with a piece occupying Water, both pieces always pass the Survival Check that their switching piece always passes that turn.  

### Then a Dragon Showed Up  
If they did not place it at the beginning of the game, a player may choose to use their turn to place their Dragon on any unoccupied, homeland Mountain. Alternately, they can choose to place it in their homeland Fortress and restart that turn, removing any piece (opponent or allied) occupying that Fortress from the game.  

### Breaching Fortresses  
A piece occupying a Fortress cannot be engaged until the Fortress is breached. A successful attack or firing (determined by a Survival Check) breaches the Fortress tile. A breached Fortress is flipped upside-down, and its occupant now vulnerable to attack next turn. It does not restore itself until it is unoccupied at a turn’s end.  
On a successful check, a Throne will breach the Fortress AND remove it’s occupier in one move.  

### Fate’s Favor  
When the game starts with a Throne occupying a Fortress, and/or when the Throne occupies a Fortress different from the one it did previously, it’s controller gains a special, single-use Fate’s Favor tile (indicated by taking one of the extra tiles the game has):  
- Haste (Plains): Adds 1 tile of movement to an allied piece that player controls.  
- Ambush (Forest): Switches positions of two allied pieces on Forests that player controls.  
- Cunning (Mountain): Automatically pass a Survival Check that player controls.  
- Deception (Water): Switches positions of any two adjacent pieces without Survival Check.  

There is a max of any 4 total per player. Only one FF tile may be spent by each player per turn. A player only needs to reveal what FF tile they have when they use that particular tile. They can use one at any time.  


## Gameplay  
1. Each player gets 15 Pieces: 11 Plains, 10 Forest, 7 Water, 7 Mountain, and 1 Fortress.  
2. Players choose even or odd, and hold numbers on their hands behind their backs and reveal them simultaneously; the sum of the numbers decides who goes first. Survival Checks can also be resolved this way.  
3. Set rule board as a screen so players cannot see opponent's homeland, and then lay pieces and home tiles; at least one of each tile type must be in each of the 4 rows and Fortresses cannot border game board boundaries.  
4. Each player is given 4 tiles (one of each type) and puts them between their front tile row and the screen, intended as where they want them placed in the middle row.  
5. Remove screen. If both players have set middle row tiles for the same contested place, first place all uncontested tiles down in the middle row; then move both contested tiles to the leftmost open space of the player that is moving first, starting from their left.  
6. The middle row Fortress occupies wherever no tile was set, after all 8 tiles are set.  
7. Whichever player goes first cannot attack/fire that turn. Winning requires the removal of your opponent's Throne or occupying the opponent's homeland Fortress with your Throne.
