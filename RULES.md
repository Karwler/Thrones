## Rules  

### Moving Pieces  
Each piece may move one tile in any direction, unless otherwise specified.  
A player may switch two adjacent, allied pieces of different types instead of moving, attacking, or firing that turn; pieces can also move through occupied allied pieces’ tiles if able.  

### Each Turn  
Each player must make one of these actions per turn.  
- Occupy at least one new tile with a piece.  
- Switch positions with an adjacent piece of a different type.  
- Engage another piece or occupied Fortress either by;  
  - Attacking: Moving on a tile and removing it's occupier a tile in any direction,  
  - Firing: Attacking a piece on a different tile without moving.  

### Survival Checks  
To Move from, Fire from, Attack from, or Attack onto a Mountain or Water tile, a piece must first make a survival check. It’s owner must either roll an even-numbered die or players must use #2 method in Standard Gameplay.  
- Survive the check with an even number; the piece may move, attack, or fire for that turn.  
- Fail the check with an odd number; the piece is removed from the game; player restarts turn. If the piece was firing OR is a Throne piece, it is not removed, the attack/move does not occur, and the player ends their turn.  
If Rangers switch positions with a piece occupying a Mountain, or if Spearmen switch positions with a piece occupying Water, both pieces always pass the Survival Check that their switching piece always passes that turn.  

### Placing Dragons  
If they did not place it at the beginning of the game, a player may choose to use their turn to place their Dragon on their homeland Fortress and restart that turn, removing any piece (opponent or allied) occupying the Fortress from the game.  

### Fortresses  
A piece that is attacking the Fortress tile or firing on the Fortress may breach it after running a Survival Check on the attacker. A successful check breaches the Fortress tile and places it upside-down; it does not restore itself until it is unoccupied at a turn’s end.  
If the Fortress tile is NOT breached, it’s occupying piece cannot be directly attacked; except by a Throne which, on a successful check, will breach the Fortress AND remove it’s occupier in one move.  

### Fate’s Favor  
When the game starts with a Throne occupying a Fortress, and/or when the Throne occupies a Fortress different from the one it did previously, it’s controller gains a special, single-use Fate’s Favor tile:  
- Plains: Adds 1 tile of movement to an allied piece.  
- Mountain: Fails an opponent’s Survival Check, or succeeds an allied one.  
- Water: Switches the positions of any two adjacent pieces without Survival Check.  
- Forest: Negates a successful attack on that turn.  

Fate’s Favor cannot change a Survival Check after it occurs or if it is always passed. There is a max of any 4 total per player and only one FF tile may be spent by each player per turn. A player only needs to reveal what FF tile they have when they use that particular tile and they can use one at any time.  

## Normal Gameplay  
1. Each player gets 15 Pieces, 11 Plains, 10 Forest, 7 Water, 7 Mountain, and 1 Fortress tile.  
2. Players choose even or odd, and hold numbers on their hands behind their backs and reveal them simultaneously; the sum of the numbers decides who goes first. Survival Checks can also be solved this way.  
3. Set rule board as a screen so players cannot see opponent's homeland, and then lay pieces and home tiles; at least one of each tile type must be in each of the 4 rows and Fortresses cannot border game board boundaries.  
4. Each player is given 4 tiles (one of each type) and puts them between their front tile row and the screen, intended as where they want them placed in the middle row.  
5. Remove screen. If both players have set middle row tiles for the same contested place, first place all uncontested tiles down in the middle row; then move both contested tiles to the leftmost open space of the player that is moving first.  
6. The middle row Fortress occupies wherever no tile was set, after all 8 tiles are set.  
7. Whichever player goes first cannot attack/fire that turn. Winning requires the remove of your opponent's Throne or occupying the opponent's homeland Fortress with your Throne.  


## Alternate Gametypes (old)  

### Victory Points  
Two players set their homelands up normally, but are not provided Fortresses (replaced with a tile of their choice). After setup, 3 Fortresses are placed in the middle row, equidistant from eachother, or randomized, based on preference. At the end of each turn, a player gets 1 Victory Point for each Fortress they occupy with an allied piece, for a total of 3 possible VP's per turn, if all three Forts are occupied; the first player to 21 wins. Losing a player’s Throne still results in their immediate defeat.  

### Ports  
Any Water tiles set on the game board's borders are considered Port tiles in this gametype; a Port allows a unit occupying it to engage any other Port tile as if the two tiles were connected.  

### Homefront  
Players may use their Throne to establish one Farm and one City midgame by moving the Throne on them and placing a second tile on top of the occupied tile.  

Farm: Lancers, Rangers  
City: Spearmen, Catapults, Elephants  
Fortress: Crossbowmen, Warhorse, Trebuchet  

- Thrones can also rebuild destroyed Fortresses correspondingly, which do not rebuild in this gametype. Dragon pieces cannot be respawned.  
- Farm and City tiles must be unoccupied to spawn a new piece, and be at least two tiles away from another spawning tile.  
- City tiles cannot be destroyed, only occupied, and cannot be established before a Farm has been established. Spawning a piece replaces movement or combat for that turn; establishing Farm or City or rebuilding a Fortress does not.  


## Thrones  
Is a game designed to cultivate cunning and strategic wisdom in a battlefield created by you, your opponent, and the battle between you. The struggle for supremacy will take many forms as your infantry melee, cavalry charge, and artillery fire. You may strike with your Throne’s royal guard or unleash a Dragon on any challenger to your claim. Not even fate itself is out of your influence and reach.  
Your enemies, however, are diverse, and their lands will be treacherous to a conqueror. Destruction of their armies is just one path to victory; if you succeed in claiming their Fortress as your own, a pretender’s family will surely plea for peace, which you can consider as their army disbands in defeat.
