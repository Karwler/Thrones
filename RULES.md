## Rules  

### Turns  
Each turn, one piece must occupy at least one new tile; switch positions with an adjacent piece of a different type; or engage another piece or Fortress, either by attacking (moving upon a tile and removing it's occupier) one tile in any direction, or by firing (attacking a piece on a different tile without moving).  

### Movement  
Each piece may move one tile in any direction, unless otherwise specified. A player may switch two adjacent, allied pieces of different types instead of moving, attacking, or firing that turn; pieces can also move through allied pieces if able.  

### Survival Check  
If a piece attempts to move, attack, or fire from a Mountain or Water tile, it’s owner must either roll an even-numbered die or use #2 method in Standard Gameplay. If Rangers switch positions with a piece occupying a Mountain, or if Spearmen switch positions with a piece occupying Water, both pieces pass the Survival Check that their switching piece always passes that turn.  
- Surviving the check with an even roll, the piece may move, attack, or fire for that turn.  
- Failing the check with an odd roll, the piece is removed from the game; player restarts turn.  

### Fortresses  
A Fortress must become ruined for it’s occupier to be engaged. This is done by attacking with a piece that is adjacent to the Fortress, or firing on the Fortress. A ruined Fortress tile is placed upside-down, and does not restore itself until it is unoccupied at a turn’s end.  

### Dragons  
If they did not place it at the beginning of the game, a player may choose to use their turn to place their Dragon on their homeland Fortress instead of taking any other action that turn, removing any piece occupying it.  

## Gameplay  
Each player gets 15 Pieces, 11 Plains, 10 Forest, 7 Water, 7 Mountain, and 1 Fortress tile.  
Players choose even or odd, and hold numbers on their hands behind their backs and reveal them simultaneously; the sum of the numbers decides who goes first.  
Set rule board as a screen so players cannot see opponent's homeland, and then lay pieces and home tiles; at least one of each tile color must be in each of the 4 rows and Fortresses cannot border game board boundaries.  
Each player is given 4 tiles (one of each type) and puts them between their front tile row and the screen, intended as where they want them placed in the middle row.  
Remove screen. If both players have set middle tiles for the same contested place, first place all uncontested tiles down in the middle row; then move both contested tiles to the leftmost open space of the player that is moving first.  
The middle row Fortress occupies wherever no tile was set, after all 8 tiles are set.  
Whichever player goes first cannot attack/fire that turn. Winning requires the death of your opponent's Throne or occupying the opponent's homeland Fortress with your Throne!  


## Alternate Gametypes  

### Victory Points  
Two players set their homelands up normally, but are not provided Fortresses (replaced with a tile of their choice). After setup, 3 Fortresses are placed in the middle row, equidistant from eachother, or randomized, based on preference. At the end of each turn, a player gets 1 Victory Point for each Fortress they occupy with an allied piece, for a total of 3 possible VP's per turn, if all three Forts are occupied; the first player to 21 wins. Losing a player’s Throne still results in their immediate defeat.  

### Ports  
Any Water tiles set on the game board's borders are considered Port tiles in this gametype; a Port allows a unit occupying it to engage any other Port tile as if the two tiles were connected.  

### Homefront  
Players may use their Throne to establish one Farm and one City midgame by moving the Throne on them and placing a second tile on top of the occupied tile.  

Farm: Lancers, Rangers  
City: Spearmen, Catapults, Elephants  
Fortress: Crossbowmen, Warhorse, Trebuchet  

- Thrones can also rebuild destroyed Fortresses correspondingly, which do not rebuild in this gametype. Dragon pieces cannot be respawned.  
- Farm and City tiles must be unoccupied to spawn a new piece, and be at least two tiles away from another spawning tile.  
- City tiles cannot be destroyed, only occupied, and cannot be established before a Farm has been established. Spawning a piece replaces movement or combat for that turn; establishing Farm or City or rebuilding a Fortress does not.
